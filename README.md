Synonym QA Engineer Challenge

Hi James Browning,

I'm Jemson Chan

The following tests are what I have thought and scripted using Playwright:

	Simple Burger menu Test Case
	Burger menu > New Channel Test Case
	NewChannel > CreateMyChannel(Edit Spending Balance) Test Case
	NewChannel > CreateMyChannel(Invalid Receiving Capacity Amount) Test Case
	NewChannel > CreateMyChannel(Min Receiving Capacity Amount) Test Case
	NewChannel > CreateMyChannel(Max Receiving Capacity Amount) Test Case
	NewChannel > ReviewChannel(T&C Unchecked Checkbox) Test Case
	NewChannel > ReviewChannel(T&C Checked Checkbox) Test Case

Due to inadequate time writing all the tests that I wanted, the following tests are what I would have done with more time:

	Burger menu > My Orders Test Case
	Burger menu > Settings Test Case
	Burger menu > Settings > Select different currencies Test Cases
	Burger menu > Support > Send Support Email Test Case
